## Model explanations
The most important features in your data for a complex machine learning model (such as an ensemble model) can be provided by training an explainable model. The explainable model is known as the surrogate model. More on how to derive the explanations from the explainable model and which explainable model to pick please refer to the [link](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/global.html).
