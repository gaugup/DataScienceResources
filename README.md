This repository houses some of the links which I found useful for data science and machine learning.

## Model explanations
The most important features in your data for a complex machine learning model (such as an ensemble model) can be provided by training an explainable model. The explainable model is known as the surrogate model. More on how to derive the explanations from the explainable model and which explainable model to pick please refer to the [link](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/global.html). 

There are other techniques on machine learning interpretibility where we compare the explanations from multiple explanations techniques like LIME and SHAP. More on these techniques can be found at the [link](https://www.oreilly.com/content/testing-machine-learning-interpretability-techniques/).

## Feature Engineering
To train a good machine learning model you require good features. Creating good features requires in depth understanding of the raw data and how to transform into the most meaningful features via feature engineering. Some of the feature engineering techniques are captured in the following links:-
